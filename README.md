>Added paypal payment feature. Users will be led paypal payment page when they click on accept and pay button. 
-> Changed the following files - To be added to Shanna's latest version:  
1) manifest file 
2) Added a PaymentDetails.java file 
3) Changed make_payment.java file 
4) Added activity_make_payment.xml file  
When project owner clicks on accept and pay button, he is led to paypal page. But when i try to login with my own 
newly created paypal account, i seem to encounter error in logging in...not sure why...
